Shooting Method for 2nd Order ODEs- The shooting method uses the same methods that were used in solving initial value
problems. This is done by assuming initial values that would have been given if the
ordinary differential equation were an initial value problem. The boundary value
obtained is then compared with the actual boundary value. Using trial and error or
some scientific approach, one tries to get as close to the boundary value as possible.
This method is best explained by an example.
